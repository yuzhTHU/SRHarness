# SRHarness: A Harness for Agentic Symbolic Regression

[English](README.md) | [简体中文](README.zh.md)

SRHarness is a domain-specific runtime for **agentic symbolic regression**. It lets a large language model inspect numerical observations, choose scientific operations, evaluate competing hypotheses, and refine a symbolic expression over a long search trajectory.

This repository contains the research code for **“SRHarness: A Harness for Agentic Symbolic Regression.”** The Python package is `sr_harness`, and its primary agent class remains `SRAgent`.

> **Research-code status:** the project is under active development. Experiment-scale runs can make many paid LLM requests and may invoke external solvers. Start with a small `R-C-L-K` configuration and inspect the generated logs before launching a benchmark campaign.

## Why SRHarness?

SRHarness organizes agentic equation discovery around three mechanisms:

- **Composable scientific actions.** Analysis, fitting, evaluation, and search tools share a common interface. Actions can operate on raw variables, transformed expressions, residuals, and other candidate-derived views.
- **Persistent scientific state.** Candidate formulas, numerical metrics, complexity, evidence, and provenance survive beyond a single conversation. Compact Pareto and top-candidate views expose useful state back to the model.
- **Trajectory lifecycle management.** A configurable `R-C-L-K` scheduler coordinates restarts, independent branches, refinement steps, and local response sampling while preserving useful intermediate results.

The included action library covers statistical and relationship analysis, formula/code evaluation, constant and structured fitting, PySR and SINDy integration, code execution, skills, and final formula submission. Tools can be enabled, disabled, or extended without changing the main agent loop.

## Results at a Glance

The accompanying paper evaluates SRHarness on LLM-SRBench, including LSR-Synth, LSR-Transform, and an anonymized LSR-Transform variant that removes scientific descriptions and variable semantics.

| Method / backbone | LSR-Transform SA | LSR-Transform-Anon SA |
|---|---:|---:|
| SRHarness + DeepSeek-v4-flash-0731 | **93.69%** | **72.97%** |
| SR-Scientist + DeepSeek-v4-flash-0731 | 62.16% | 39.64% |
| Codex + DeepSeek-v4-flash-0731 | — | 20.72% |

These are symbolic-accuracy results reported in the manuscript. See the paper for the complete numerical, symbolic, complexity, resource, and ablation results, as well as the exact evaluation protocol.

## Installation

### Requirements

- Linux is the primary tested platform.
- Python **3.12 or newer** is required.
- Git and a working C/C++ toolchain are recommended.
- Some optional actions have additional requirements, such as Julia for PySR or PyTorch for neural components.

The following setup mirrors [`scripts/install.sh`](scripts/install.sh) while using HTTPS clone URLs:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yuzhTHU/MySRAgent.git SRHarness
cd SRHarness

conda create -p ./venv python=3.12 -y
conda activate ./venv

# nd2py is currently installed from source.
git clone https://github.com/yuzhTHU/nd2py.git ./third-party/nd2py
pip install -e ./third-party/nd2py

# Core package plus development/test dependencies.
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Install optional components as needed:

```bash
pip install -e ".[web]"       # Web search-tree viewer
pip install -e ".[tools]"     # PySR, gplearn, PySINDy, and PDF integrations
pip install -e ".[nn]"        # Experimental neural components
pip install -e ".[all]"       # Everything above
```

## Provider Configuration

Copy the tracked environment template once, then fill in only the providers you use:

```bash
test -f .env || cp .env.sample .env
```

For example, OpenRouter requires:

```dotenv
OPENROUTER_API_KEY="sk-or-v1-..."
```

The code also contains adapters for DeepSeek, Gemini, OpenAI/Azure OpenAI, SiliconFlow, LM Studio, and manual interaction. See [`.env.sample`](.env.sample) for the corresponding variables. Never commit `.env`; it is ignored by Git.

## Quick Start

Run a small synthetic problem:

```bash
conda activate ./venv

sr-harness run \
  --equation "y = sin(x1 - x2)" \
  --x-low -10 \
  --x-high 10 \
  --llm-provider openrouter \
  --llm-model deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash \
  --force-initial-diagnostics \
  -R 1 -C 1 -L 3 -K 1
```

This command performs paid API calls. Its search budget is controlled by:

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `R` | restart rounds initialized from persistent historical candidates |
| `C` | independent conversational branches per restart |
| `L` | refinement steps per branch |
| `K` | locally sampled responses per refinement step |

The nominal number of model responses is approximately `R × C × L × K`, although retries and provider behavior can affect actual usage.

### Python API

```python
import numpy as np
from sr_harness import SRAgent

x1 = np.linspace(-3.0, 3.0, 100)
x2 = np.linspace(3.0, -3.0, 100)

agent = SRAgent(
    llm_provider="openrouter",
    llm_model="deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash",
    max_restart_loop=1,
    global_width=1,
    max_refinement_depth=3,
    local_sample_size=1,
    save_path="logs/python_api_demo",
)

result = agent.run(
    X={"x1": x1, "x2": x2},
    y={"y": np.sin(x1 - x2)},
    problem_description="Discover y as a function of x1 and x2.",
)
best = result["candidates"][result["best_candidate"]]
print(best["formula"])
```

## LLM-SRBench Evaluation

Download the benchmark data. Git LFS may be required:

```bash
git lfs install
git clone https://huggingface.co/datasets/nnheui/llm-srbench \
  ./data/llm-srbench-data
```

Run one LSR-Transform problem before scaling up:

```bash
sr-harness bench \
  --algorithm my_sr_agent \
  --datasets lsrtransform \
  --problem-names II.6.15b_1_0 \
  --exp-name smoke_lsrtransform \
  --llm-provider openrouter \
  --llm-model deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash \
  -R 1 -C 1 -L 3 -K 1
```

Add `--anonymize` to replace variable names and scientific descriptions with generic input/output labels while leaving the numerical observations unchanged:

```bash
sr-harness bench \
  --algorithm my_sr_agent \
  --datasets lsrtransform \
  --problem-names II.6.15b_1_0 \
  --exp-name smoke_lsrtransform_anon \
  --anonymize \
  --llm-provider openrouter \
  --llm-model deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash \
  -R 1 -C 1 -L 3 -K 1
```

The benchmark entry point also contains adapters for conventional and LLM-based baselines; `sr-harness bench --help` lists its general options, while each adapter defines its method-specific flags. Paper-scale reproduction requires the exact model, toolset, data split, token limit, seed, and `R-C-L-K` configuration reported with each experiment; the smoke commands above intentionally use a much smaller budget.

## Logs and Web Visualization

`SearchRunState` always keeps the live run in memory. When `save_path` is enabled, it also writes:

- `run.json`: the globally unique run ID and agent metadata;
- `nodes.jsonl`: search nodes, parent relations, prompts, actions, results, and usage;
- `result.json`: candidates plus the Pareto-front and best-candidate indices;
- `response.jsonl`: raw model responses and token/cost accounting;
- `tool_calls.jsonl`: tool invocations and outputs;
- text logs and entry-point-specific result files.

With `save_path=None`, search identity, parent relations, candidates, and results remain fully
available through `agent.run_state`, while no search-state files are created.

Install and launch the web viewer:

```bash
pip install -e ".[web]"
sr-harness web --log-dir logs --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

Then open <http://127.0.0.1:8000/>. The Web API and search viewer read the active session's
in-memory `SearchRunState`; they do not depend on persisted run files.

![SRHarness Web search-tree viewer](assets/web.png)

The workbench opens on **Data & Problem**. Select or upload a CSV or Excel workbook, assign one
target and one or more features, edit variable descriptions, and drag variables into the
X/Y/Hue/Size slots for a quick relationship preview. The data-preparation Agent can inspect the
persistent workspace, clean or join tables, search and read public Web sources, and atomically
publish a numeric target and aligned features into the shared `AgentContext`. Its conversation and
workspace survive later requests. The direct structured-data workflow remains available without
using this Agent. SRHarness generates the initial system and user prompts from the resulting
configuration; either prompt remains editable before the run starts. The included `demo.csv`
contains three input columns (including one categorical column) and one numeric target.

During a run, **Timeline** shows model reasoning, tool calls, results, token/cost usage, and control
events, while **Current Context** exposes the messages associated with each R-C-L node. The search
tree and candidate panel stay linked to those nodes and can switch between all ranked candidates
and the Pareto front. Guidance, model changes, pause/resume, stop, and inline `ask_human` replies
take effect at safe operation boundaries. The interface supports Chinese/English text, light/dark
themes, and resizable or collapsible side panels.

The data-preparation Agent and `SRAgentInteractive` keep separate message histories while sharing
one `AgentContext`. To add features during search, pause symbolic regression, ask the preparation
Agent to create and commit the aligned columns, then resume. At the next safe iteration boundary,
the SR Agent detects the new data revision, rebuilds its train/validation split, tells the existing
conversation which variables were added, and continues with its prior evidence and candidates.
While a search is active, data commits may add features but cannot alter the target, row alignment,
or previously used values; those changes require a new run because old candidate metrics would no
longer be comparable.

### Research backends, subagents, and live control

The default tool set includes recursive per-subtree EIC diagnostics (`evaluate_eic`), an actual
MDLformer-guided SR4MDL search (`sr4mdl`), NDformer-guided network-dynamics search (`nd2`), bounded
symbolic-regression hypothesis/critique delegation (`delegate_subagent`), web search, and PDF
reading. Configure heavyweight external projects with `SR4MDL_HOME` and `ND2_HOME`, and point
`SR4MDL_CHECKPOINT` to the trained MDLformer checkpoint. Repositories placed at
`third-party/SR4MDL` and `third-party/ND2` are discovered automatically. When `evaluate_eic` is
enabled, each newly generated scalar candidate receives a lightweight structural audit whose
diagnostics are retained in candidate state. Documentation for EIC, SR4MDL, and ND2 is exposed as
runtime read-only skills by each tool's `get_doc()` method.

`Agent` contains the common API, parser, and tool-execution mechanics used by
`DataPreparationAgent` and `SRAgent`; `SRAgentInteractive` specializes the shared `SRAgent` search
loop with human control and frontend events. `AgentContext` owns the structured data, active split,
workspace, variable descriptions, provenance, and data revision shared by cooperating agents.

`SRAgentInteractive` accepts an `InteractionManager` that connects its shared search loop to a
frontend. Its default `TerminalInteractionManager` handles `ask_human` in a terminal. The Web
workbench injects a `WebInteractionManager`, which binds the run state and workspace to its session,
handles pause/resume/stop and queued guidance at safe boundaries, and publishes model, tool, and
candidate events. Frontend adapters do not own the scientific search state or duplicate the R-C-L
loop. Model auto-routing can use a cheap base backend for simple/early requests and an optional
strong backend for complex or stagnated searches. Configure
`strong_llm_provider`/`strong_llm_model`, or pass `auto_routing=False` to keep every request on the
base backend.

## Evaluation and Reproducibility Notes

- Benchmark test observations are not exposed during search or candidate selection.
- The agent can reserve part of the visible training data for random or OOD-style validation using `--validation-fraction` and `--split-by`.
- Numerical predictions are evaluated through the shared benchmark pipeline. Symbolic equivalence is implemented in [`src/sr_harness/utils/symbolic_acc.py`](src/sr_harness/utils/symbolic_acc.py).
- Logs preserve prompts, model responses, tool calls, candidate provenance, token usage, and recorded cost so that a run can be audited after completion.
- API behavior, model aliases, prices, and stochastic outputs can change over time. Record the exact provider model identifier, source revision, arguments, and environment for serious comparisons.

## Extending SRHarness

New scientific actions inherit `BaseTool`, declare stable metadata, and return a serializable result. Candidate-producing actions should use the shared evaluation contract so their formulas, train/validation metrics, complexity, diagnostics, and provenance can enter persistent scientific state consistently.

See:

- [`src/sr_harness/README.md`](src/sr_harness/README.md) for the agent loop and internal architecture;
- [`src/sr_harness/tools/README.md`](src/sr_harness/tools/README.md) for the action API and custom-tool guide;
- [`tests/README.md`](tests/README.md) for testing conventions.

Repository conventions:

- Add user-facing commands as `sr-harness` subcommands under `src/sr_harness/cli/`.
- Put experiment and analysis utilities under `scripts/`.
- Name analysis notebooks as `YYMMDD_description.ipynb` and avoid committing large outputs.
- Treat `data/`, `logs/`, and `playground/` as local working directories.

## Testing

The default test configuration excludes tests marked `slow` or `paid`:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

Run paid or slow integration tests only when the required services and budget are available.
